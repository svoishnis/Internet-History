          <h4>JCR Licklider</h4>
          <ul>
            <li> - “Father of Information Theory”
              <br>- Invented the mathematics or theoretical groundwork for a way that a message could self-correct itself and check if the rest of the message is correct.
              <br>- Rather than send one long message we send the in small portions.
              <br>- This was the functional theory for packet-switching
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Robert Elien Kham</h4>
          <ul>
            <li> - Robert Elien Kham made the first hardware in 1965 – 1969 and sent the first packet using these self-correcting messages.
              <br> - ARPANET was a direct result of this technology that focused solving two of the main issues
              <br> - With circuit switching, if the wire was cut then there is no way to send the message over to confirm there was no loss of information or tampering.
              <br> - The desire to send data rather than just a voice.
              <br> - By 1972, the ARPANET composed of 37 companies including universities, research collaborators, and government labs.

          <ul>
            <li>- Co-founder and CEO of Microsoft
              <br>- Bill Gates was able to commission an operating system for IBM from an electronics company and made it work on their computers
              <br>- Created the MSN – the Microsoft security network thought the internet was like a toll road
              <br>- Feared the growth of Netscape to change the foundation of the Internet where the browsers could hold the power
